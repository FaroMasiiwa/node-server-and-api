# Vanilla Node.js Web Server

This project is a basic Node.js server built **without using any frameworks**. It serves static HTML files and includes basic routing logic for both a webpage and a 404 handler.

## Features

- **Serve a static HTML page**  
  When you navigate to `/index.html`, the server renders a simple HTML page with basic student information.

- **404 Page for Unknown Routes**  
  When you navigate to any other `.html` file (e.g., `/random.html`, `/about.html`), the server responds with a custom 404 page.
